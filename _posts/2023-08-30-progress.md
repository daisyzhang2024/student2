## *Week 4:*
- In our group of 4, we split up the work. One group was assigned to the calculator, and the other group was assigned to the grade calculator. Eventually we all worked on the calculator and grade calculator.
- I implemented the calculator and grade calculator
- With the help of ChatGPT I added the "/" function. On my own, I added the "âˆš" function.

## *Week 3:* 
- I pulled different projects with code from ChatGPT. I pulled the Calculator game and Game of Life game.
- I implemented WASD keys in my snake game with the help of ChatGPT.
- I got my jupyter notebook to work! I still have to figure out how to use it and run it but I took notes, so hopefully those will help
- I added an adjustable table

## *Week 2:* 
- I cloned the repository again to amend my botched files. I figured out how to create the Submenu, linking it to tabs Course, About, and Table. I created a plan.
- I personalized the website by creating Course, About, Resume and Table .md files; I added my progress to the Blogs page. I also attempted to edit the table but it wouldn't let me for some reason. Reviewed [Build a Student Page](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/teacher//c4.3/c5.0/2023/08/17/markdown-html_fragments.html 'Build a Student Page'). 
- I edited the "view on Github" button to link to my own github and unlinked all of the files to add my progress log. I  committed my work to Github.
- I figured out how to add an apple as the food in the Snake game.
